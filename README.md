##  About Us

The **Agentic Systems Lab**, part of the Chair of Information Management at **ETH Z√ºrich**, is dedicated to designing, developing, and evaluating **agentic AI systems** in real-world environments.

We are committed to helping ambitious, high-agency students grow into the next generation of AI talent by:

üîó Connecting them with a community of like-minded builders

üöÄ Providing access to leading AI startups and innovators

üè≠ Curating opportunities to apply agentic AI in established industries

üéì Offering hands-on guidance and cross-sector expertise from researchers and industry collaborators


##  Student Opportunities

Interested in a thesis or semester project? Join our **Genesis Batch 2025**, a collaborative cohort of **10‚Äì20 master‚Äôs students** working on agentic AI applications with real-world impact.

###  Tracks Available:
- **Lab Track** ‚Äì Collaborate on internal lab projects focused on agentic system design, development, and evaluation.  
- **Explorer Track** ‚Äì Partner with startups or industry collaborators to ideate, prototype, and validate agentic systems.  
- **Startup Track (Bring Your Own Project)** ‚Äì Develop your venture or prototype into a robust agentic application or publication-ready research paper.
